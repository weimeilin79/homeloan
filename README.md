JBoss Fuse Home Loan Demo
===========================================================
For people that are getting started to know Fuse, and wants to get their hands dirty and develop a JBoss Fuse project for the first time.

The story behind the home loan demo is we have a system, that takes in XML files from different vendor's home loan application into a folder, and we will need to process the data give house an appraised value and then provide the information back to the vendors.
